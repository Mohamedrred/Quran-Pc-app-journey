# Quran Pc app
I'm a high school student working on this small project in my free time. I'm doing it as a way to learn Python; don't expect a lot of changes in a short period of time. I don't have a lot of time on my day, so... yeah, I'm not that good in Python, so don't expect anything good. You can use my code anyway you like. I don't care; it is not that good anyway. 😔


I am using the Quran API, which is for the most part good but has a lot of changes needed. When you look at my code, you will know what I mean.
