# Quran Pc app
I'am a high school student working on this small poject on my free time, i'am doing it as a way to lean python, don't expect a lot of changes in shot period of time, i don't have a lot of time on my day so.... yeah, also am not that good in python so don't expect anything good. you can use my ode anyway you like i don't care, it is not that good anyway 😔


i am using the Quran api which is for the most part good, but has a lot of changes needed, when you look at my code you will know what i mean.
